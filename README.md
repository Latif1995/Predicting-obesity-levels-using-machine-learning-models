# Predicting obesity levels using machine learning models

### Project Overview
---
Obesity has been linked with numerous diseases including cardiovascular infections, diabetes, kidney problems, as well as psychological problems such as depression, anxiety etc. Therefore, there is an urgent need for early detection of individuals at high  risk of becoming obese. This project therefore aims at building machine learning models to predict levels of obesity. This will aid in earlier identification of individuals who are likely to become obese in order to provide them with the needed support.

### Data Sources
The data for this project is from Nikhita et al.(2024). The dataset contains 2111 cases and 17 variables. These variables covers data about demographics, lifestlye factors, physical activities,and dietary patterns. For more information about the data, readers should consult Nikhita et al.(2024).
